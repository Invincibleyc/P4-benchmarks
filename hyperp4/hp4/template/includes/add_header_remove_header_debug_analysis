Case:

parser extracts nothing
- nevertheless hp4 'extracted' 40B to ext_first
- hp4 then copied ext_first to extracted.data

extracted.data:
00-39: packet pr
40+: empty

ingress adds 6B header
extracted.data:
00-05: new header
06-45: packet pr

-------

FIX1: a_resize_pr_* actions need to take into account ext_first having the first 40B

FIX2: set parse_ctrl.numbytes to 40 in parser

So but now what about remove_header?
- Need to revise resize_p4.p4t - prep ext[] for numbytes < 40 because we
  will use ext[] *instead* of ext_first
- Need to revise deparse_prep.p4t and invocations in hp4.p4t:
  - handle numbytes < 40 by not copying back to ext_first but instead
    copying back to ext[]
- Need to revise parser to extract ext[] immediately when numbytes < 40
  and not extract ext_first (this because final deparsing is based on the parser)
