HP4 for HW Project

  Appendix E. P4 Design Limits

Field size: 256B / 2048b
- non-constant shifts, multiply, divide, and modulo may only take operands of 4B / 32b or less

Combined Header Sizes: 820B, where each header is aligned to 4B boundary
- includes header and metadata

Number of headers in stack: 16
- "this may be lower under certain conditions" - no further information given

Width of current() limited to 32B / 256b

Max number of tables: 256

Max entries in a table: 64K

Limits on fields for matching: 640b
- 40 segments, each 16b; small fields < 16b still occupy a segment

Max actions: 256

Size of all parameters for single action <= 92B / 736b
- effective value may be lower due to overhead for packing action data

Accumulated action data width for all actions executed for a packet processed
within the pipeline <= 224B / 1792b:
- 4B + action parameter size for each action

Max 248B headers can be removed

-----

Number of tables is a limiting factor; table at ../analysis/results_tables.ods
shows which configurations are supported, e.g.:
- 2 x 9
- 3 x 8
- 4 x 5
- 5 x 4
- 6 x 3
- 8 x 2
- 9 x 1

Tasks:
- [COMPLETE] Determine # actions per:
  - stage
  - num primitives / stage
  Fill in a table for stages 1-9 x # prims 1-9
- RESULT: 150; number is constant regardless of num stages / primitives supported
  - this number will increase as we support more primitives, but we are well under
    Agilio's limit

- [IN PROGRESS] Determine all hp4 fields > 32b and whether each is involved in:
  - shift - all offending cases are shifts
  - multiply - none
  - divide - none
  - modulo - none
  Fields:
  - [good] csum.csmask 768b
    - used: checksums.p4::a_ipv4_csum16
  - [bad] tmeta.data 256b
    - bad uses:
      - modify_field.p4::mod_extracted_meta
      - modify_field.p4::mod_stdmeta_egressspec_meta
  - [bad] extracted.data 800b
    - bad use:
      - modify_field.p4::mod_extracted_extracted
      - modify_field.p4::mod_meta_extracted
      - add_header.p4::a_addh
      - checksums.p4::a_ipv4_csum16
  - [good] extracted.validbits 80b
- RESULT: 3/5 large hp4 fields are involved in shift operations Agilio can't handle
  - dozens of operations to fix
  - do not know at this point what the fix options are... need to re-read the doc - maybe not all are bad.  DevTools: "Non-constant shifts, multiply, divide and modulo operations may only take operands of 32-bits or less."
