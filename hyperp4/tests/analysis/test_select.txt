The test_select test confirms that p4_hp4 (compiler) does not support
select(current(x, y)) return statements in parser functions.

Examining what the HLIR looks like for 1) P4 parser select(<field>)
and 2) P4 parser select(current(x, y)):

simple_router::return select(ethernet.etherType) from 'start':
h.p4_parse_states['start'].return_statement:
('select',
 ['ethernet.etherType'],
 [([('value', 2048)], 'parse_ipv4'),
  ([('default',)], 'ingress')
 ]
)

0: 'select'
1: list of fields used as criteria - each element is of type 'str'
2: list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:
   - a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of:
     - 'value' or 'default'
     - if the first element is 'value', second element is the numeric value
   - name of the next node (a parser function or control function)

test_select::return select(current(0, 48)) from 'start':
h.p4_parse_states['start'].return_statement:
('select',
 [(0, 48)],
 [([('value', 17179869184)], 'parse_eth1'),
  ([('value', 17179869185)], 'parse_eth2'),
  ([('default',)], 'ingress')
 ]
)

0: 'select'
1: list of fields used as criteria, but if the element is a tuple, evidently
   that is the indicator that 'current' is in use, with the tuple consisting
   of the offset and width
2: list of tuples... as above

DO: have p4_hp4 detect use of 'current' by looking at the type of the elements of the second element of the return_statement
- e.g.:
    if isinstance(criteria_fields[0], str):
      # does not indicate use of 'current'
      pass
    elif isinstance(criteria_fields[0], tuple):
      # indicates use of 'current'
      pass

A point of confusion:

p4_hp4::build calls the following methods in order of appearance:
- ...
- gen_tset_parse_control_entries
- gen_tset_parse_select_entries

From gen_tset_parse_control_entries, we call walk_parse_tree, which calls
fill_tics_match_params.

This would imply that fill_tics_match_params supports the generation
of entries for tset_parse_control, not tset_parse_select.

However, fill_tics_match_params seemingly generates match parameters
appropriate for tset_parse_select table entries.

Need to examine how return value of fill_tics_match_params is used.

See line 592.

t.match_params where t is a TICS object.
t.table is from self.tics_table_names, which is populated by process_parse_state,
and is always a tset_parse_select_* table.

process_parse_state called from walk_parse_tree, called from gen_tset_parse_control_entries.

Evidently tics_list, a list of objects where each objects stores information required to generate a tset_parse_select_* table entry, must be populated before gen_tset_parse_select_entries, where the action and action parameters are generated
to complete the tset_parse_select_* table entry.

In other words, perhaps gen_tset_parse_control_entries is a bit of a misnomer, as
it does more than simply generate tset_parse_control entries.

-----

The fix consisted of checks for the type of the criteria field in a few locations
to avoid a KeyError on '(0, 48)' in field_offsets and h.p4_fields, substituting the
examination of the tuple for the proper setting of any offset and/or width variable
needed to construct tset_parse_select match parameters.  Functions affected:
- fill_parse_select_match_params (previously named fill_tics_match_params)
- fill_parse_select_match_params_under40 (previously: fill_tics_match_params_under40)

Inspecting impact of fix warrants examination of p4_hp4's data structures related to:
- tset_parse_control entries
- tset_parse_select_* entries
- tset_pipeline_config entries

This includes:
- field_offsets
- ps_to_pc
- pc_to_ps
- pc_to_preceding_pcs
- pc_bits_extracted
- parse_select_table_names
- vbits
- commands
