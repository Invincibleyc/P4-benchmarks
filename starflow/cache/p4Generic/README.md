# StarFlow generic P4_14
*This is an implementation originally compiled for the tofino, but with all platform specific (i.e., NDA sensitive) stateful functions removed. Psuedocode for the stateful functions is in statefulFunctions.p4 -- to get this working on BMv2, implement the psuedocode as custom primitives that extend the simple_switch target.*
